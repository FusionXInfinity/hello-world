Nevermind.\r\nHey guys, this is FusionXInfinity (you can call me Fusion) and I'm learning how to code. I do know a thing or two about coding JavaScript and HTML. Oh, what's that?

Feel free to use my source code, but at least give some credit to me if you use my source code. I am a noob at Java right now, but that'll change soon, so don't worry. I'm not here to waste your time, if you're wondering. Okay, I just ran out of words to type, so I'll finish it off here.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
